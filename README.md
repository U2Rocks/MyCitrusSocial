# Citrus Social Network

## Summary

This is a test social network app for the mycitrus brand(original site: http://www.mycitrus.net/) that allows users to share information via text and images.

## Build

The app uses react and tailwind for the front end and firebase firestore for holding back end data.

### Final Comments and notes

-- Basic uses of app are work(signing in, creating a user, making a post, reading from the backend...)

-- Google authentication has trusted types error

-- Memory leak occurs when google signed in user adds a post

-- Home page reloads too many times when post is added(5-7 times)
